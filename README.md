# Rapid Diet

This is a rapid weight loss diet.

It provides enough nutrition that you can stay on it for a long time, perhaps a month or more.
But check with your doctor and/or nutritionist first.

It is designed for satiety and compliance. I find it easy to comply with because I don't get
cravings or need to fight hunger (the protein shakes are satiating), and yet it works fast
enough that I am motivated to stick with it.

I started with water fasting, but wanted something I could maintain for a longer period of
time.

I used whole foods easily available to me and which I prefer. As I am providing the source code,
you can modify this to add foods more easily available to you.

The nutrition profile isn't perfect. The diet probably needs some tweaks. Getting 100% of RDI
is very hard with such a low energy diet, which is why the multivitamin is suggested for every
other day.
